This repository includes:

* Code for training and testing our model for temporal moment localization [DORi: Discovering Object Relationships for Moment Localization of a Natural](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Rodriguez-Opazo_DORi_Discovering_Object_Relationships_for_Moment_Localization_of_a_Natural_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)
* Links to the I3D and object features we extracted for the YouCookII, Charades-STA and Activity-Net which were used for the experiments in our paper.
* Links to pre-trained models on the YouCookII, Charades-STA and Activity-Net datasets. 

# Installation

1. Clone this repo                                                                                                              
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crodriguezo/DORi.git
   cd DORi
   ```

2. Create a conda environment based on our dependencies and activate it

   ```bash
   conda create -n <name> --file environment.txt
   conda activate <name>
   ```

   Where you can replace `<name>` by whatever you want.

2. Download everything
   ```bash
   sh ./download.sh
   ```
   This script will download the following things in the folder `~/data/DORi`: 
   * The `glove.840B.300d.txt` pre-trained word embeddings.
   * The I3D features for Charades-STA, YouCookII and Activity-Net we extracted and used in our experiments.

   This script will also install the `en_core_web_md` pre-trained spacy model, and download the pre-processed annotations.

   Downloading everything can take a while depending on your internet connection, please be patient. 

## Configuration
 If you have modified the download path from the defaults in the script above please modify the contents of the file `./config/settings.py` accordingly.

# Training

To train our model in the Charades-STA dataset, please run:
```bash
python main.py --config-file=experiments/CharadesSTA/CharadesSTA_train.yaml
```
# Testing

To load our pre-trained model and test it, first make sure the weights have been downloaded and are in the `./checkpoints/charades_sta` folder. Then simply run:

```bash
python main.py --config-file=experiments/CharadesSTA/CharadesSTA_test.yaml
```
